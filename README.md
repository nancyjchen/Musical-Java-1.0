# Musical-Java-1.0

Purpose: Allow users to play pre-coded songs in any instrument they select
Challenges: Incorporating dynamics (soft & loud volume) into the song and formatting the music into code, since mistakes are hard to find
Overall: Combining my computer science and music knowledge, I had fun making this project. :)

**Recommended IDE**: Visual Studio Code
