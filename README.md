# Musical-Java-1.0
Musical Java 1.0 is a simple, easy to use program that allows the user to play songs, which are already pre-coded into the program. With the use of JFugue, the user can choose what instrument plays the song. 
Some challenges I've faced is adding in dynamics (soft & loud) into the song, as there were many times where the mistake can be hard to find. 

I recommend running this project on Visual Studio Code, since that's the IDE that I used to create this project. 
However, if you're planning to run this project on other IDEs such as IntelliJ or Eclipse, make sure to include the files from the /lib/ and /src/ folders & the image files. 

Overall, this program allowed me to combine my music & computer science knowledge.

Have fun! :D

-----

The songs can be found on MuseScore. I made sure to pick the songs that (a) aren't under a license, (b) had a copyright waiver, or (c) are in the public domain.
Song include: Jingle Bells, Twinkle Twinkle Little Stars, 'Life Will Change' From Persona 5, & 'It's Ladybug' from Miraculous Ladybug.
